 Please perform two critical tasks to fix the application. First, restructure the Solana lesson track by removing the initial four lessons and re-indexing the rest. Second, completely remove the AI Assistant feature from the lesson pages.

Task 1: Restructure Solana Track Lessons
The goal is to make the current Lesson 5 the new Lesson 1, effectively deleting the first four introductory lessons.

Modify the Lesson Data Source:

Navigate to the file containing the lesson data array (this should be src/data/lessons.ts or a similar file).

Inside the main lessons array, identify and delete the objects for the first four lessons of the Solana track.

After deleting them, update the id property of all remaining Solana lessons. The lesson that was originally id: 5 must now have id: 1. The lesson that was id: 6 must now have id: 2, and so on. Ensure the numbering is sequential, starting from 1.

Verify Navigation:

Open the file src/pages/Lessons.tsx.

Locate the "START SOLANA TRACK" button.

Verify that its onClick handler navigates the user to the correct path for the new Lesson 1 (e.g., /lessons/1). This should work automatically if the IDs were updated correctly in the data file, but it is critical to confirm.

Clear Invalid User Progress:

Open the state management file for lesson progress (likely src/hooks/use-lesson-store.ts).

To prevent users from being stuck on a non-existent lesson, add logic to clear any saved progress from local storage for the Solana lessons that were just deleted. A simple way to do this is to reset the progress state for the entire Solana track.

Task 2: Remove AI Assistant Feature
This feature is cumbersome and needs to be completely removed from the UI for now.

Edit the Main Lesson Component:

Open the file src/pages/LessonDetail.tsx.

Remove All Assistant Code:

Delete the Import: Find and remove the line: import { HintCharacter, type HintCharacterRef } from "@/components/lessons/HintCharacter";.

Delete the Component from JSX: In the return statement of the component, find and delete the entire <HintCharacter ... /> JSX block.

Delete the useRef Hook: Find and remove the line: const hintCharacterRef = useRef<HintCharacterRef>(null);.

Delete All Function Calls: Search the entire file for any calls made using the reference, such as hintCharacterRef.current?.showHint(...) or hintCharacterRef.current?.showProgressiveHint(...), and delete these lines.

Delete the "Request AI Assistance" Button: In the side panel JSX, find the <TechButton> with the text "REQUEST AI ASSISTANCE" and delete its entire parent div container.
