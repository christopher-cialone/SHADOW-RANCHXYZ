"Hello! We need to restructure the Solana Developer Track to improve user experience and focus on the core coding lessons. This involves removing the first four introductory lessons and re-indexing the remaining lessons.

1. Modify Lesson Data Source:

Locate the file where the lesson data is stored (likely src/data/lessons.ts or a similar file).

In the lessons array, find the objects corresponding to the Solana track.

Delete the first four lesson objects from this array (the ones that were previously lessons 1, 2, 3, and 4).

Update the id property of the remaining Solana lessons. The lesson that was originally id: 5 should now be id: 1, the one that was id: 6 should be id: 2, and so on. Ensure the IDs are sequential and correct.

2. Update Navigation in Lessons.tsx:

Open the src/pages/Lessons.tsx file.

Find the "Solana Program Development" card.

Locate the onClick handler for the "START SOLANA TRACK" button.

The current navigation is likely setLocation('/lessons/1') or similar. Confirm this directs to the new first lesson of the Solana track. Since we've re-indexed the lessons, this might already be correct, but it's crucial to verify the id it's pointing to is now the new lesson 1 (the old lesson 5). If the old lessons had different IDs (e.g., starting from a higher number), update the navigation to point to the correct new starting ID.

3. Ensure LessonDetail.tsx Handles New IDs:

Open the src/pages/LessonDetail.tsx file.

Review the logic that fetches the lesson data: const lesson = lessons.find(l => l.id === lessonId);. This logic is dynamic and should work correctly with the new IDs without any changes.

However, pay close attention to the handleNext function. The logic window.location.href = \/lessons/${lessonId + 1}`;` assumes that all lesson IDs are sequential. After your changes, this should hold true, but it's a key area to double-check to prevent future navigation bugs.

4. Reset User Progress (Important):

Because we are fundamentally changing the lesson structure, existing user progress for the Solana track will be invalid.

Open the store responsible for lesson progress (likely src/hooks/use-lesson-store.ts or similar).

Add a function to reset or clear the progress specifically for the old, now-deleted lesson IDs. You can call this once manually or build logic to clear it for users to ensure no one is stuck on a non-existent lesson. A simple approach is to clear all lesson progress from local storage to start fresh.
