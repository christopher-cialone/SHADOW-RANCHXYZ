As a Replit agent, your task is to redesign the mobile version of the "Ethos" page, implementing a **Simplified Accordion with Visual Cues** approach to make the extensive text content digestible and less overwhelming. This design should prioritize a clean, sequential reading experience.

**Current State Analysis (Mobile):**
The page currently features a long, static scroll of text, which is visually dense and difficult to read on a mobile device.

**Desired Implementation - Approach 2: Simplified Accordion**

1.  **Accordion Structure:**
    * Transform each text section ("A Foundation for Web3," "The Pioneers," etc.) into a self-contained accordion panel.
    * All panels should be collapsed by default when the user first arrives on the page.
    * The header of each accordion panel should be the section title, stylized with a prominent icon (e.g., a number or a simple geometric shape) and a clear neon blue color.
    * Tapping on the header should smoothly expand the panel to reveal the full text content. Tapping it again should collapse it.

2.  **Sequential Reading Flow:**
    * The primary navigation method should be tapping to expand the next section.
    * The design should encourage the user to proceed linearly through the content. For example, when one panel expands, other open panels could optionally collapse to keep the focus on the current section.
    * The "Cypherpunks write code" quote and the "Start Your Cypherpunk Journey" button should be placed below all the accordion panels, appearing at the very end of the page's content flow.

3.  **Aesthetics and Responsiveness:**
    * Each accordion panel should be a distinct, visually appealing "card" with rounded corners and a dark background that matches the app's overall theme.
    * The headings should be highly visible and act as clear touch targets.
    * Ensure the font within the expanded panels is set for optimal readability on mobile, with appropriate line height and font size.
    * Use subtle transition effects for the expansion and collapse of the panels to provide a polished feel.
