Hello! Please update the user profile page UI based on the following requirements. The goal is to create a cleaner, more professional, and user-friendly experience by removing outdated testing elements and redesigning the achievements section.

1. Remove All Testing and Debugging Elements:
The profile page currently contains several elements that were used for testing and troubleshooting. These are no longer needed and should be removed completely from the user's view.

Remove the "Server-Side Firebase Architecture" Banner: Delete the entire notification banner at the top of the content area that explains the backend architecture. This is developer information and not relevant to the user.

Remove the "Speed Test" Button: Delete the "Speed Test" button and its associated icon located in the top-right corner, next to the user's profile dropdown.

Remove Redundant User ID: The user's full ID (CTzd...KbdF) is displayed twice. Remove the instance located directly under the main "User_CTzdKU" heading. The ID in the top-right navigation bar is sufficient.

2. Redesign the "Achievements" Card:
The current achievements card is cluttered and the icons overlap, making it difficult to read. Let's redesign it for clarity and better visual appeal, using a grid layout.

Layout: Change the layout to a clean 2x3 grid. This will provide ample space for each achievement, prevent overlap, and create a structured look.

Achievement Item Design:

Each item in the grid should consist of an icon and its name displayed directly below it.

Locked State: For achievements the user has not unlocked, the icon should be grayed out (e.g., opacity: 0.4) and display a "lock" symbol. The name text should also be grayed out.

Unlocked State: For unlocked achievements, the icon should be fully colored (using our theme's primary or accent color) and the name text should be bright and clear.

Spacing: Ensure there is adequate padding within the card and consistent spacing between each grid item to give the design room to breathe.

Title: Keep the "Achievements" title and the "X/6 Unlocked" counter as they are, but ensure they are aligned cleanly with the new grid container.

Please apply these changes to create a more polished and intuitive profile page for our users."

This prompt clearly outlines the "what" and the "why" for each change, which should give the agent everything it needs to execute the vision. Let me know what you think!
