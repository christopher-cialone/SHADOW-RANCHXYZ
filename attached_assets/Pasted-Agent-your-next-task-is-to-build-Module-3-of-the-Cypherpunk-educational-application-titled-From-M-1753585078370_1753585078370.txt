Agent, your next task is to build Module 3 of the Cypherpunk educational application, titled "From Mailing List to Mainnet." This module is crucial as it connects the foundational Cypherpunk philosophy to the creation of Bitcoin.

Please modify the existing application with the following features and logic:

1. Update Application Progress and Navigation:
* In the main App component, update the logic to handle user progress. If a user has completed Module 2 (40% progress), the "Continue Track" button should now launch CypherpunkModule3.
* Upon completion of this new module, the track's progress should be updated to 60%.

2. Create the CypherpunkModule3.js component:
* This component will manage the step-by-step flow for the third lesson.
* The narrative will guide the user from the "double-spend problem" to the DAO Hack dilemma. Use a state variable (step) to manage the user's progression through the module's chapters and interactive elements.

3. Implement the Core Content and Interactive Elements for Module 3:

* **The Double-Spend Problem:**
    * Create a chapter that explains this core challenge. You can use a simple animated diagram showing a digital coin being copied and failing to be spent at two places simultaneously.

* **The Satoshi Nakamoto Introduction:**
    * Create a chapter titled "The Ghost in the Machine."
    * Visually style this section to look like an archival email from a mailing list, presenting Satoshi's famous introductory message about a "new electronic cash system."

* **Interactive Game: "Connecting the Dots":**
    * Create a new component for this interactive challenge.
    * On the left side of the screen, display a list of four Cypherpunk concepts: `Anonymous eCash`, `Decentralized Servers`, `"We Write Code"`, and `Digital Signatures`.
    * On the right side, display a list of four Bitcoin features: `Pseudonymous Addresses`, `Peer-to-Peer Network`, `Open Source Codebase`, and `Public/Private Key Crypto`.
    * The user must connect the correct concept to its corresponding feature. A simple click-to-connect mechanic is sufficient. When a user clicks a concept, it becomes "active." When they click the correct feature, a line is drawn between them, and the pair is locked in as "correct."
    * The user cannot proceed until all four pairs are correctly connected.

* **Interactive Dilemma: "The DAO Hack":**
    * Create a component that presents the user with the philosophical crisis of The DAO Hack.
    * Clearly state the two choices the Ethereum community faced: uphold "code is law" or intervene via a fork.
    * Provide a `<textarea>` input for the user to write their thoughts. This is a reflective exercise, not a quiz. The content does not need to be validated, but the user should be able to type in the box.
4. Create the Module 3 Completion Screen:
* After the DAO Dilemma, transition to a "MISSION 3 COMPLETE" screen.
* Showcase the newly unlocked "Bitcoin Genesis Badge," using a suitable Bitcoin icon.
* The "Return to Dashboard" button should trigger the state update, setting the track's progress to 60%.
