As a Replit agent, your task is to redesign the "Ethos" page, focusing on improved content organization, navigation, and visual appeal, especially for mobile devices. Implement an "Interactive Sectioned Scroller" approach.

**Current Page State:**
The page currently features a video followed by several static text blocks ("A Foundation for Web3," "The Pioneers," "The Web3 Connection," "Building the Future"), a quote, and a CTA button. The video autoplays. The overall aesthetic is dark and futuristic.

**Desired Implementation - Approach 1: Interactive Sectioned Scroller**

1.  **Video Handling:**
    * Keep the video prominent at the top.
    * **Crucially, disable autoplay.** Instead, display a large, central play button (matching the existing "cyberpunk" aesthetic with neon blue accents) over the video thumbnail. The video should only play when explicitly clicked by the user.

2.  **Content Sectioning:**
    * Divide the main text content into distinct, visually separated sections: "A Foundation for Web3," "The Pioneers," "The Web3 Connection," and "Building the Future."
    * Each section should be presented within its own "card" or container, similar in style to the event cards on the "Crypto Wars Timeline" page (rounded corners, dark background, subtle border/glow).
    * Ensure generous padding and margin around each section for readability and visual separation.

3.  **Sticky Progress Navigation:**
    * Implement a sticky navigation bar at the top of the viewport (below the main app header) that appears as the user scrolls past the video.
    * This navigation bar should contain clickable links/labels for each content section (e.g., "Foundation," "Pioneers," "Web3 Connection," "Building Future").
    * As the user scrolls, highlight the currently active section in the navigation bar using the neon blue accent color.
    * On mobile, this navigation bar should be compact and highly responsive (e.g., a horizontal scrollable list of short labels, or a vertical stack of dots/indicators on the side).

4.  **Smooth Scrolling & Snapping:**
    * Implement smooth scrolling to anchor links when a section is clicked in the navigation.
    * Optionally, implement scroll-snapping behavior so that each section "snaps" into full view as the user scrolls, providing a more controlled reading flow.

5.  **Visual Enhancements & Responsiveness:**
    * Maintain the existing dark background, subtle grid patterns, and neon blue accent colors.
    * Ensure all text within the content cards is highly legible on both desktop and mobile, adjusting font sizes and line heights as needed for smaller screens.
    * The "Cypherpunks write code." quote should be visually distinct and impactful, perhaps in a larger, italicized font, centered within its own card.
    * The "Start Your Cypherpunk Journey" button should be prominently displayed at the end, maintaining its current visual style and responsiveness.

6.  **Code Structure:**
    * Provide a complete HTML structure, internal CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the interactive elements (video play, sticky navigation, scroll highlighting, optional scroll snapping).
    * Use modern HTML5 and CSS3 features. Ensure robust cross-browser compatibility.
    * Add comprehensive comments to explain the logic and styling.
