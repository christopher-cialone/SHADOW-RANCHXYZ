Replit Agent Prompt: Update Header Title to 'Data 70' Font and Lowercase, and Remove Letter GlitchObjective: Change the font of your app's main header title ("Welcome to the Shadow Ranch") to "Data 70" and convert it to lowercase ("welcome to the shadow ranch"). Additionally, remove the LetterGlitch background section.Instructions for the Agent:Remove Letter Glitch Section:Locate the main component file for your app's homepage (e.g., src/App.tsx, src/pages/Home.jsx, or similar).Identify and remove the entire <section> block that contains the LetterGlitch component. This section typically has className="relative w-full h-96 overflow-hidden" and includes the LetterGlitch and potentially an h1 with "Code Forge".Remove the import LetterGlitch from './components/LetterGlitch'; statement from the top of the same homepage component file.Import 'Data 70' Font into Main CSS:Locate your primary CSS file: This is typically src/index.css or src/App.css in a React project.Add the following @import rule at the very top of that CSS file. This tells the browser to fetch the "Data 70" font from Google Fonts:@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Data+70&display=swap');

/* Existing CSS content follows below this import */
Configure Tailwind CSS to Recognize 'Data 70':Locate your tailwind.config.js file in the root of your project.Modify the theme.extend.fontFamily section to include 'Data 70'. This makes it available as a Tailwind utility class (e.g., font-data70). If this section doesn't exist, create it within the theme.extend object.// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ... your content paths
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        // Add or ensure this line exists
        data70: ['"Data 70"', 'monospace'], // Fallback to monospace if Data 70 fails
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    // ... your plugins
  ],
};
Locate and Update the Header Title:Identify the component or specific HTML element in your app's header that currently displays "Welcome to the Shadow Ranch". This might be in src/App.tsx, src/components/Header.jsx, or a similar file.Modify the text content of this element to be all lowercase: welcome to the shadow ranch.Apply the font-data70 Tailwind class to this element. For example, if it's an h1 or div:<h1 className="font-data70 text-4xl text-white">welcome to the shadow ranch</h1>
<!-- Adjust text size (e.g., text-4xl) and color (e.g., text-white) as needed for your design -->
Important: Ensure you combine this with any existing styling classes already on that element, keeping font-data70 to apply the desired font.Verification for the Agent:After applying these changes, restart the Replit app.Visually confirm that the LetterGlitch background is no longer present.Check the app's header:The title text should now read welcome to the shadow ranch (all lowercase).The font of this title should be "Data 70".Use the browser's developer tools (usually F12) under the "Elements" tab. Select the header title element and inspect its computed styles to ensure font-family: "Data 70", monospace; is being applied.
