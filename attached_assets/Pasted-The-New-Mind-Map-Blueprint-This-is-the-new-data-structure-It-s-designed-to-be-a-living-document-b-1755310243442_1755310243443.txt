The New Mind Map Blueprint
This is the new data structure. It's designed to be a "living document" by providing a source for every point of data, setting a standard for future user contributions.

Central Node: History of the Internet

This is the new starting point, tracing the evolution from a decentralized ideal to a centralized reality.

Branches:

ARPANET (1960s): The decentralized, resilient military project that started it all.

Web 1.0 (1990s): The "read-only" era of open protocols, featuring key milestones like the Rise & Fall of Netscape and the pivotal CDA Section 230 legislation.

Web 2.0 (2000s-Present): The "read-write" era of corporate dominance, leading to the Rise of Big Tech and the business model of Surveillance Capitalism.

Primary Branch: Cryptography

This branch now connects directly to the history of the internet, showing how secure communication evolved.

Sub-branches:

Public-Key Cryptography: Featuring pioneers Diffie & Hellman and Phil Zimmermann's PGP, which sparked the Crypto Wars.

Key Individuals: Now includes David Chaum, the "godfather of digital cash," whose work on DigiCash was a crucial early experiment.

Primary Branch: The Cypherpunk Movement

This branch emerges from the intersection of early internet culture and the fight for cryptography.

Sub-branches:

Key Individuals: Features Timothy May, Eric Hughes, and Wei Dai, whose "b-money" directly influenced Bitcoin.

Bitcoin: Presented as the direct culmination of the Cypherpunk dream for anonymous digital cash.

Primary Branch: The Smart Contract Revolution

This represents the next major evolutionary step, growing out of the possibilities unlocked by Bitcoin.

Sub-branches:

Key Individuals: Now a comprehensive list including Nick Szabo (the originator of the smart contract concept), Vitalik Buterin (the visionary behind Ethereum), and Gavin Wood (the technical architect of the EVM).

Core Concepts: Ethereum and its major philosophical test, The DAO Hack.

Primary Branch: The Intelligence Connection

This critical branch connects the dots between technological development and state-level interests.

Sub-branches:

DARPA's Dual Legacy: Explores its role in creating both the decentralized ARPANET and surveillance tools.

Whitney Webb's Research: A dedicated node linking to her work on the ties between intelligence, tech, and crypto.

"Total Information Awareness": The post-9/11 program that laid the groundwork for mass surveillance.

Primary Branch: The Legal Battlefield

This branch details the ongoing fight to define the future of decentralization in the courts.

Sub-branches:

Roman Storm (Tornado Cash): The pivotal case for developer liability.

Roger Ver ("Bitcoin Jesus"): Highlighting the conflict between sovereign individuals and nation-states.

The "Code is Speech" Debate: The central legal argument defending open-source development.

Primary Branch: Corporate Co-option vs. Ethos

This branch addresses the internal struggle for the soul of Web3.

Sub-branches:

The Rise of CEXs and the cautionary tale of the FTX Collapse.

"Fake Decentralization" and the influence of Venture Capital.

Now, here is the prompt for your Replit agent to implement this final, comprehensive version of the mind map.

Prompt for Replit Agent (Final Mind Map Overhaul)
Agent, your final task for the mind map is to completely overhaul it with a new, deeply-researched, and restructured data set. The goal is to create a comprehensive, living document that serves as a central educational resource for the entire application.

Please execute the following instructions:

1. Restructure the Mind Map's Core Logic:
* The central, root node of the mind map must now be the "History of the Internet."
* All other major topics (Cryptography, The Cypherpunks, etc.) should be reconfigured as primary branches stemming from this new center.

2. Replace the Entire Data Set:
* You must delete the entire existing mindmapData object.
* Replace it with the new, final, and fully expanded mindmapData object provided below. This new object contains numerous new nodes, individuals, concepts, and a sourced link for every single entry.

3. Implement a User Contribution Feature:
* Add a new, non-interactive element to the UI, such as a button or link at the bottom of the page labeled "Suggest an Addition."
* This button should link to a pre-filled mailto: link that opens the user's email client. The email should be addressed to contributions@shadowranch.xyz with a subject line like "Mindmap Suggestion" and a body that provides a template for users to fill out (e.g., "Suggested Node Title:", "Blurb:", "Source Link:"). This creates a simple, effective way to gather community contributions for this living document.

4. Verify Final Implementation:
* Ensure the mind map renders correctly with the "History of the Internet" at its center.
* Confirm that every node is clickable and that the info panel correctly displays the new, detailed blurbs and functional links for each.
* Verify that the new "Suggest an Addition" button is present and functional.
