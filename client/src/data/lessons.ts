                    challenge: `Welcome, digital homesteader! In this decentralized frontier, we value true ownership and privacy. Unlike the old world where deeds were on paper in a dusty office, here, your ranch deed can be controlled by pure code! This is the essence of **cypher-punk** â€“ using cryptography and decentralized tech to protect privacy and freedom.
                    Today, we're diving into **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)**. Imagine your ranch deed isn't owned by a specific wallet with a private key, but by a special, unhackable 'strongbox' that *only your ranch program can open*. This strongbox address is *derived* from your program's ID and some unique 'seeds' (like a secret password) and a 'bump' (a special number to make sure it's valid). This makes your ranch truly **decentralized** and secure, giving control to the smart contract itself, not a person's key.

                    **Your Task:**
                    1.  In the \`InitializeRanch\` struct (Rust) or function definition (Python), locate the \`#[account(...)]\` attribute for your \`ranch\` account.
                    2.  **Add a \`seeds\` argument** to this attribute. For the ranch, the seeds will be the byte literal \`b"ranch"\` and the owner's public key (\`owner.key().as_ref()\` in Rust, \`owner\` in Python).
                    3.  **Add a \`bump\` argument** to this attribute. This is a special nonce that ensures the PDA is valid.`,

                        python: 'seeds=\\[\'ranch\',\\s*owner\\]\\s*,\\s*bump'
                    },
                    successMessage: "Fantastic! Your ranch account is now a true Program Derived Address (PDA)! Its deed is safely locked away, controlled by your program, not a private key. You've embraced programmatic ownership!",
                    failureMessage: "Not quite. Double-check your PDA syntax. Did you add `seeds` and `bump` correctly within the `#[account(...)]` attribute (Rust) or `init` arguments (Python)? Remember the exact values for the seeds (`b\"ranch\"` and the owner's key) and that `bump` is also required!",

                    2.  A special number (the 'bump') that makes sure the lockbox address is perfect and unhackable.
                    Look at the \`#[account(...)]\` line for the \`ranch\` in Rust, or the \`.init()\` call in Python, and add the \`seeds\` and \`bump\` keywords!`
