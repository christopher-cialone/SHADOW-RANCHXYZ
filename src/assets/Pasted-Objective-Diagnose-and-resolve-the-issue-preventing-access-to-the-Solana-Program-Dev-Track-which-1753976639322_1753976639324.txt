Objective: Diagnose and resolve the issue preventing access to the "Solana Program Dev Track" (which is rendered by the ShadowRanchChallenge component). This includes checking navigation logic, component rendering, and console errors.

Instructions for the Agent:

Examine src/App.jsx (or your main routing component):

Verify currentPage State: Check if the useState hook for currentPage is correctly defined and initialized (e.g., const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState('home');).

Inspect Navigation Button/Link: Locate the button or link that is supposed to take the user to the "Solana Program Dev Track."

Confirm its onClick handler correctly calls setCurrentPage('shadowRanchChallenge') (or whatever string you've assigned to this page).

Add a console.log("Attempting to navigate to ShadowRanchChallenge"); inside this onClick handler to confirm it's being triggered.

Review Conditional Rendering: Find the section where pages are conditionally rendered based on the currentPage state.

Ensure there is a line similar to {currentPage === 'shadowRanchChallenge' && <ShadowRanchChallenge />}.

Verify that ShadowRanchChallenge is correctly imported at the top of App.jsx: import ShadowRanchChallenge from './pages/ShadowRanchChallenge'; (adjust path if needed).

Add a console.log("Rendering:", currentPage); just before the conditional rendering block to see what currentPage is set to.

Check Browser Console for Errors:

Crucial Step: When you attempt to access the "Solana Program Dev Track" in your Replit preview, open your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect") and go to the Console tab.

Report all errors and warnings: The agent should look for any JavaScript errors (red text), React warnings (yellow text), or network errors that appear specifically when you click the button to go to the Dev Track. These messages are vital clues.

Common errors to look for: "Component is not defined," "Cannot read properties of undefined," "Maximum update depth exceeded," or any errors related to ShadowRanchChallenge or its dependencies.

Inspect src/pages/ShadowRanchChallenge.jsx:

Component Export: Ensure the ShadowRanchChallenge component is correctly exported at the bottom of its file: export default ShadowRanchChallenge;.

Initial State/Dependencies: Check if there are any immediate errors or missing imports within ShadowRanchChallenge.jsx itself that might prevent it from rendering.

Proposed Codebase for Robust Routing (if needed):
If the current routing in your App.jsx is problematic, here's a more robust structure for state-based routing you can implement. This ensures clear separation and handling of different pages.

// src/App.jsx (Example for robust state-based routing)

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import CypherpunksEthos from './pages/CypherpunksEthos';
import ShadowRanchChallenge from './pages/ShadowRanchChallenge';
// Import your Home component if it's separate
// import Home from './pages/Home';

function App() {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState('home'); // Default to 'home'

  // Function to render the current page component
  const renderPage = () => {
    console.log("Current Page to Render:", currentPage); // Debugging log
    switch (currentPage) {
      case 'home':
        // Replace <YourHomeComponent /> with your actual home page content
        // or the existing content that was directly in App.jsx
        return (
          <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-900 text-white p-8 md:p-12 lg:p-16">
            {/* Your main home page content goes here */}

            <p className="text-center mt-4 text-gray-300">This is your main landing page content.</p>
            {/* Example of the Cypherpunk Blueprint section if it's on the home page */}

        );
      case 'cypherpunks':
        return <CypherpunksEthos />;
      case 'shadowRanchChallenge':
        return <ShadowRanchChallenge />;
      default:
