Agent, your next task is to significantly expand the content of the existing "Mindmap" page. You will be adding a new major branch for "The Smart Contract Revolution" and incorporating several key historical figures into the data structure.

Please modify the mindmapData constant within the MindmapPage component with the following additions and changes. The existing rendering logic should not need to be altered.

1. Add a New Top-Level Branch:
* Inside the children array of the root 'solana' node, add a new object for "The Smart Contract Revolution." It should be structured like the other main branches ("The Cypherpunks," "Cryptography," etc.).

2. Populate "The Smart Contract Revolution" Branch:
* This new branch should have two main children: "Key Individuals" and "Core Concepts."
* Under "Key Individuals," add the following nodes:
* Vitalik Buterin: Blurb should mention the Ethereum whitepaper and the Scalability Trilemma.
* Gavin Wood: Blurb should mention the EVM Yellow Paper, Solidity, and Polkadot.
* Nick Szabo: Blurb should mention his pioneering work on the concept of smart contracts.
* Under "Core Concepts," add the following nodes:
* Ethereum: Blurb should describe it as the first Turing-complete blockchain for dApps.
* The DAO Hack: Blurb should explain its significance as a philosophical crisis and its role in the Ethereum fork.

3. Update "The Cypherpunks" Branch:
* Navigate to the children array of "The Cypherpunks" -> "Key Individuals."
* Add a new node for David Chaum: The blurb must mention his role as the "godfather of digital cash" and his creation of DigiCash using blind signatures.

4. Verify Data Structure:
* Ensure all new nodes have a unique id, a title, a detailed blurb, and a relevant link for the "Learn More" button.
* The nested structure of parent and child nodes must be correct for the mind map to render properly.

Please update the existing mindmapData object with this new, deeply-researched information. The application should then dynamically render the expanded, more comprehensive mind map.
