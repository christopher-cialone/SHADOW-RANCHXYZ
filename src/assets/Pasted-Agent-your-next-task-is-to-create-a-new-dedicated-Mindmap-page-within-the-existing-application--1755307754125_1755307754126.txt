Agent, your next task is to create a new, dedicated "Mindmap" page within the existing application. This page will feature the detailed, interactive mind map we have designed, but with an improved visual layout.

Please implement the following changes and features:

1. Add a New Page and Navigation:
* In the main Header component, add a new navigation link titled "Mindmap" alongside "Home," "Ethos," etc.
* Clicking this "Mindmap" link should render a new page component, MindmapPage.
* Update the main application router/state to handle the display of this new page.

2. Create the MindmapPage.js Component:
* This component will be responsible for displaying the interactive mind map.
* It should have a title at the top, such as "An Interactive History of Web3."

3. Integrate the Mind Map Content:
* Use the large, detailed mindmapData JavaScript object from our previous session. This object contains all the nodes, blurbs, and links.

4. Implement a "Spider's Web" Visual Layout:
* Use a Force-Directed Graph: Instead of the previous simple radial layout, you must implement a force-directed graph to create a more organic, "spider's web" appearance. This is the most critical part of the task.
* Node Repulsion: Nodes should push away from each other to avoid overlap.
* Link Attraction: Links should act like springs, pulling connected nodes closer together.
* Centering Force: The entire graph should gently gravitate toward the center of the screen.
* Recommendation: Use a library like D3.js (d3-force module) to handle the physics simulation, as it is the industry standard for this task. You can load it via a script tag.

5. Re-implement the Interactive Elements:
* Rendering: Render the nodes as circles and the links as lines using SVG, driven by the positions calculated by the force simulation.
* Interactivity:
* Clicking a node should highlight it and its path back to the central "Solana" node.
* The information panel on the right should display the title, blurb, and link for the currently selected node.
* The nodes should be draggable with the mouse to allow the user to manually adjust the layout.

6. Styling and User Experience:
* Maintain the application's established dark theme, with cyan highlights for active nodes and paths.
* Ensure the force simulation is stable and visually pleasing.
* Include a small instruction on the screen for the user, such as "Click and drag nodes to explore the network."

Please generate the complete code for the new MindmapPage component and show the necessary modifications to the main App and Header components to integrate this new page.
